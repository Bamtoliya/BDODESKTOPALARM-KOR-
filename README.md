# BDODESKTOPALARM-KOR-

This is a desktop applicaiton with the C#
It shows your local time and Korea time.
Black Desert Online Korea server alarm inside the game doesn't work with the foregin local time.
So I made desktop application to alarm the World bosses.

Top : Korea Time
Bottom : Your Local time
